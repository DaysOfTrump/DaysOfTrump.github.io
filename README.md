# 1461 Days of Trump

4 years seems like an awful long time. But 1,461 days somehow sound shorter.

Assuming Trump isn't reeleceted and a new President is sworn in on the 20th January 2021, Trump will be in power for:

* 4 Years (duh)
* or 208 weeks and 5 days
* or 1461 days
* or 35,064 hours
* or 2,103,840 minutes
* or 126,230,400 seconds

## Day 0 - Inaguration

Trump's inaguratin speech was pure nationalism

Embarisingly small crowds in Washington with many empty seats

## Day 1 - Women's March

Half a million women (and quite a few men) march in Washington protesting largly agaist Trump as well as to promote womens issues. Marches are simultaniously held around the world including London & Sydney. Overall about 600 marches took place (inc. one in Antartica) with well over a million people taking places

The numbers is washington where clearly higher than those for the Inaguration but no official figures have been released

## Day 2 - #SpicerFacts

Trump's Press Secretary [Sean Spicer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Spicer) has achived 'Meme' status following comments on crowd numers yesterday

## Day 3 - Execuative Orders

Today Trump discovered Execuative Orders and so has been making planty of them

Of note include:
* Withdrawl from [TPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership)
* Weakning of 'Obamacare'
* Ban on international abortion counselling (tricky one to do with US funded forign NGOs)
* Halt hiring of new staff by the federal government
