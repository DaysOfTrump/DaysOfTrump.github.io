Today Trump discovered Executive Orders and so has been making plenty of them

Of note include:
* Withdrawl from [TPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership)
* Weakening of 'Obamacare'
* Ban on international abortion counselling (tricky one to do with US funded forign NGOs)
* Halt hiring of new staff by the federal government
