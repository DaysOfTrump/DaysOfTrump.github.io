title: Day 172 - Russia (Again)
author: Zander

Trump Jr has essentially disproved his father's claims that the Trump campaign had no connections with Russia

He achieved this by releasing an email chain, he claimed he did so in the interests of transparency but it has later come to light that the New York Times was threatening to publish if he didn't

Something of note is that the final message is a forwarding of the complete conversation to Jared Kushner & Paul Manafort, who are President Trumps Son-in-law & former campaign manager respectively. The two have previously denied knowing the purpose of the meeting. The statement 'Meeting got moved' suggests the meeting was discussed with Jared & Paul at some point other than these emails.


Of course as is common with this administration the emails where released via two tweets:
* [Status 884789418455953413](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/884789418455953413) ([Mirror](http://web.archive.org/web/20170711150824/https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/884789418455953413))
* [Status 884789839522140166](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/884789839522140166) ([Mirror](http://web.archive.org/web/20170711150933/https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/884789839522140166))

The conversation was released along with the following statement:

> To everyone, in order to be totally transparent, I am releasing the entire email chain of my emails with Rob Goldstone about the meeting on June 9, 2016. The first email on June 3, 2016 was from Rob, who was relating a request from Emin, a person I knew from 2013 Ms. Universe Pageant near Moscow. Emin and his father have a very highly respected company in Moscow. The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research. I first wanted to just have phone call but when that didn't work out, they said the woman would be in new York and asked if I would meet. I decided to take the meeting. The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government official. And, as we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act. To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue. As Rob Goldstone said just today in the press, the entire meeting was "the most inane nonsense I ever heard. And I was actually agitated by it."

Trump Jr has repeatedly said he didn't want to have a meeting and learnt nothing from it, however, the fact that he agreed to have contact with someone claiming to be connected to the Russian government reflects very badly on the administration whether they were actually from Russian or not (or anything was learned).
