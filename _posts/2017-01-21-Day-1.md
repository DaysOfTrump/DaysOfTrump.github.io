Half a million women (and quite a few men) march in Washington protesting largely agaist Trump as well as to promote women's issues. Marches are simultaneously held around the world, cities including London & Sydney. Overall about 600 marches took place (inc. one in Antartica) with well over a million people taking part

The numbers in washington were clearly higher than those for the Inauguration but no official figures have been released
